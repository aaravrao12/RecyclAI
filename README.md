# Project Description
This project is a deep learning-based classifier designed to automatically sort recyclable and non-recyclable waste, with a specific focus on minimizing contamination. Built on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, the classifier is trained to accurately differentiate between various waste types, classifying items into three main categories: recyclable, non-recyclable, and contaminated recyclables. By automating the sorting process, this classifier aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of waste management systems, contributing to better recycling practices and reduced contamination rates in recycling facilities.

# Project Goals
Reduce Contamination in Recyclables: Improperly sorted recyclables, often contaminated with food waste or non-recyclable materials, can spoil entire batches, making recycling efforts less efficient. This project aims to solve this problem by distinguishing contaminated recyclables from clean ones.

1. Enhance Waste Sorting Efficiency: By accurately classifying waste items, this classifier can improve the speed and efficiency of waste sorting processes in recycling facilities and other waste management setups.

2. Promote Environmentally Friendly Practices: Effective waste sorting is essential to the recycling process. By aiding the sorting process, this classifier encourages better resource management and a positive environmental impact.

# How It Works
1. Image Processing: The classifier uses images of waste items as input. Each item is scanned or photographed and then analyzed by the CNN model.
   
2. CNN-Based Classification: The deep learning model, based on a CNN architecture, has been trained on a dataset of images categorized into three classes: recyclable, non-recyclable, and contaminated recyclables. The CNN model identifies patterns and features unique to each type of waste, making it capable of classifying new images accurately.

3. Output and Recommendations: After classification, the system provides output indicating whether the item is recyclable, non-recyclable, or contaminated. This output can be used in various applications, such as in smart bins or recycling facility sorting mechanisms, to direct the item to the appropriate processing stream.

# Future Work
To enhance the modelâ€™s performance and applicability, future improvements could include:

1. Deploying in Real-World Applications: Testing the classifier in real-world environments, such as at a recycling facility, to evaluate and refine its performance.

2. Create a smart bin, which would automatically separate materials into 3 sections. It would work with this model integrated into a sensor
